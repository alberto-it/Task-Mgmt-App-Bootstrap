# Task Management App

## Description

A prototype for a web-based application using Bootstrap that allows users to manage their tasks. Users would be able to register, login, create tasks, set priorities, track progress, and view details of existing tasks.

## Features

* User Registration and Login
* Task Creation
* Due Date Setting
* Task Prioritization (Low, Medium, High)
* Task Status Tracking (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
* Task Details View
* Responsive Design

## How to Run

Copy the repository containing the eight HTML files and one image file, and open index.html.

## Notes
* To see the Task Details Page, click on the <u>Reserch Travel</u> link on the Task Dashboard Page. The remaining dummy tasks on the page will be unresponsive.
* Clicking the <u>Update Status</u> link on the Task Details Page will send the user to a fake <b>Sorry... Currently Under Construction</b> page.
* Clicking the <u>Create Task</u> button on Task Creation Page will take the user to a fake <b>Task Created Successfully</b> page.
